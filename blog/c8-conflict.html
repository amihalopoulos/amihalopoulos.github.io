                Before I began my journey in web development, I was working for my dad’s construction company. It was the start of the summer and we had some extra cash to do some advertising. This is where the conflict arose. I wanted to do some form of online advertising—either google or yelp. I did a lot of research and gave an informal presentation on why we should use google ads. It didn’t take too long into this informal discussion for me to realize that my dad had been set all along on using Super Coups for advertising. I couldn’t believe it. Instead of targeted advertising, he’d rather try to shoot bullets into a pond and hope to hit a fish. I felt frustrated because I thought my dad was being ignorant, didn’t understand technology, and wasn’t progressing with the times. However, the fact remained that it was his decision and the conversation was over then and there.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the experience I learned a couple things. First of all, my informal presentation was mediocre at best. I fully expected my dad to jump on board with my ideas and didn’t bother learn enough about google ads to be able to convince him. So lesson 1 was to ALWAYS come prepared no matter what the circumstances. Secondly, I should have spoken in his terms, instead of my own. Instead of only telling him about the technology and how many people it will reach, etc, I should have compared it directly to the current form of advertising he was pursuing and made it easier for him to understand. So lesson #2 is speak in terms of your audience’s wants and needs. This is what I would do if I could go back in time.
