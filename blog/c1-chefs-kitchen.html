                The DBC experience is definitely a once in a lifetime experience. It will truly be an educational rollercoaster unlike any that I have ever experienced before. In addition to learning how to be a world-class beginner at web development, I'm expected to open myself up to the experience and really discover myself. I feel as though this bootcamp is about learning more about myself as much as it is learning how to code. It is completely different from all the formal education I have ever had and I can't wait to get to campus.

                I'm going all in on DBC. I've spent my savings on it, cleared my schedule (and my mind), and am ready to take this challenge full on. If I don't make it out alive, it will truly be because I'm not capable and not because I didn't work hard enough. The day I first walk through those doors will be with an open mind and open heart. I am bringing my full self and just hope that its enough to survive! Honestly, I'm the most nervous about leaving the people in my life for so long. My family is in New Jersey (and my 1 1/2 year old puppy, Barry, who I'm sure I'll talk about more than enough) and my girlfriend lives in Philadelphia. I've been avoiding thinking about how I won't be able to see or talk to them much and I think it's time to jsut accept it. This is such a special experience that I am truly grateful to have and will need the support of those around me.
