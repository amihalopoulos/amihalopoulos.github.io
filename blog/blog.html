      <section>
        <p>
          From taking the Gregorc Thinking Style Test, I learned that I was an Abstract Random (AR) Thinker.  Well, technically I am an abstract random thinker, even though I scored a 32 in that category while I scored a 28 on every other category. So in reality, I (as well as most people, I presume)probably have more of a hybrid thinking style.  However, for the sake of this blog I'm going to assume that I am an Abstract Random thinker because the characteristics of such thinkers do in fact resonate with me.  Thelearningweb.com defines AR thinkers as people who "organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments."  In line with AR thinkers, I learned that I learn best when I am..
            <ul>
              <li>in a personalized environment</li>
              <li>given broad/generalized directions</li>
              <li>able to maintain friendly relationships</li>
              <li>able to participate in group activities</li>
            </ul>
          In addition, I learned as an AR thinker that I need
            <ul>
              <li>frequent feedback</li>
              <li>ability to use my creativity</li>
              <li>teamwork and collaboration</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is that Dev Bootcamp seems to offer the perfect environment for someone like me. The bad news is that such an environment can also be stressful for me.  From doing more research, I learned that Abstract Random thinkers are inclined to be very in tune with other peoples emotions and try to make everyone happy.  For example, if you were to ask me if I wanted chinese or italian food for dinner, though I know exactly which one I want, I would have trouble speaking up out of fear that my choice would keep you from having what you want. Yes, yes, yes, and yes.  That happens to me all the time.  In fact, this has led to my only struggle in DBC so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times, pairing has been a struggle for me so far.  There have been a couple occurences where I was very confident in what my pair and I needed to do in order to solve a problem, but did not speak up immediately because my pair was speaking aloud as he/she tried to solve the problem in a way I knew was incorrect.  I just feel bad/awkward telling them that what they are doing is wrong.  This is something I will need fix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going forward, I plan to be patient and ask questions when pairing.  There is a right way and a wrong way to go about telling someone they are wrong, and it is important to make sure to correct someone before going down a rabbit hole when pairing.  Also, I would like to challenge myself to try and learn harder programming concepts.  Reading about Fixed vs Growth mindsets taught me that its okay to fail and/or not understand something.  That's what Dev Bootcamp is all about. If I fall on my face trying to solve a problem, I have a great community and opportunity to help pick me up and set me down a path towards success.

        <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
        <h4>Wednesday Jan 28, 2015</h4>
      </div>
      <section>
        <p>Arrays</p>
        <p>Think of an array as an empty bucket.  Whenever you want it, you just pick it up and toss whatever you'd like in it. In Ruby, all you need to do is name the bucket and either leave it as empty for future use or name the bucket and say what you want to put it in it.  You can put strings, numbers, more arrays, hashes, etc. Arrays can hold pretty much anyhting. You can create an empty array one of two ways:
           <p> Method 1: <br>
            new_array = [] <br>
            Method 2: <br>
            new_array = Array.new() </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, you can add values to an array at the same time as you create it. Like so: </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                new_array = ["cat", "hat", "bat"]
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>To access an item in your array, you type the number where the item is located in the array in brackets after the array.  Remember that arrays are numbered starting from 0. So in the above example, to access "cat" you would type:<br>
            </p>
            <pre> <code>
                > new_array = ["cat","hat", "bat"]
                => ["cat", "hat", "bat"]
                > new_array[0]
                => "cat"
                > new_array[1]
                => "hat"
                > new_array[2]
                => "bat"
                > new_array[3]
                => nil
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                Arrays come with their own set of methods from the class Array.  In addition, you can add two arrays as well as subtract them.  Adding arrays will put all the values of the two arrays into one array. Subtracting one array from a second array will return all the items of the first array that were not in the second array.  Lastly, you can find all common items of two arrays by joining them with an ampersand (&) likes so: <br>
                    >[1,2,3]&[2,3,4]<br>
                    => [2,3]
            </p>
            <p>Arrays have many more methods that come with their class. Check them out.</p>
            <p>Hashes</p>
            <p>
                Hashes are very similar to arrays in that they both store data.  The main difference is that hashes store their data through the use of "keys" and "values" while arrays store their data by using indices. So all data in a hash is a value and every value has a key. Making a hash is similar to making a new array. Only difference is the use of squiggly brackets {} instead of square [] that are used for arrays: </p>
                <pre><code>
                > new_hash = Hash.new
                => {}
                > new_hash = {}
                => {}
                </code></pre>
                <p>To match a value to a key when creating a new hash, you use the hash rocket (=>) like so:
                </p>
                <pre><code>
                favorite_athletes = {"football" => "Tom Brady", "basketball" => "Michael Jordan", "baseball" => "Derek Jeter"}
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                  Hashes are good to use when you have more data or data within data that you need to store.

        <h2>The Big 3 Display Property Values: Block, Inline, & Inline-block</h2>
        <h4>Friday Jan 24, 2015</h4>
      </div>
      <section>
        <p>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</p>
            <p>
            In my experience in CSS thus far, I have used the "display" property very, very often. I am sur emost of you have as well.  However, despite how much I use it, I realized that I never had a clear understanding of what each of the three manin values for this property affected the layout of my web pages.  If one didn't produce the desired layout change, I would simply try one of the others.  If you are like me, hopefully this will help better your understanding so you can save time by picking the right display value the first time, every time.
            </p>
            <p>
            When it comes to block, inline, and inline-block, the main differences are in how the width and height are set, whether or not you can change the width and height, and if it can have neighbors (only one of them can't)
            We'll start with block.  you write it like so:
            </p>
                display: block; <br>
            What you need to know about blocks:<br>
                1. width is is set by its parent and its height set by its content.<br>
                2. You CAN change the widths and heights.<br>
                3. This DOES NOT ALLOW horizontal neighbors--This means if you use a block, the content inside that block will be the only content on that line.<br>
            <p>
            Next up, inline.  Written as:
            display: inline; <br>
            What you need to know about inline: <br>
                1. An element set to Inline will have its width and height determined by its content.<br>
                2. You cannot change the height and width. It will simply be the size of the content you put in.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Last, inline-block. Written as:
              display: inline-block;<br>
            What you need to know about inline-block:<br>
                1. It's the same as block<br>
                **EXCEPT**<br>
                2. Width is determined by its content.<br>
                3. BUT, you CAN set its width and height.<br>

        <h2>Culture at DBC: My thoughts heading into DBC</h2>
        <h4>Sat Jan 17, 2014</h4>
      </div>

        <section>
    <p>
      The DBC experience is definitely a once in a lifetime experience. It will truly be an educational rollercoaster unlike any that I have ever experienced before.  In addition to learning how to be a world-class beginner at web development, I'm expected to open myself up to the experience and really discover myself. I feel as though this bootcamp is about learning more about myself as much as it is learning how to code. It is completely different from all the formal education I have ever had and I can't wait to get to campus.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm going all in on DBC.  I've spent my savings on it, cleared my schedule (and my mind), and am ready to take this challenge full on.  If I don't make it out alive, it will truly be because I'm not capable and not because I didn't work hard enough.  The day I first walk through those doors will be with an open mind and open heart.  I am bringing my full self and just hope that its enough to survive!  Honestly, I'm the most nervous about leaving the people in my life for so long. My family is in New Jersey (and my 1 1/2 year old puppy, Barry, who I'm sure I'll talk about more than enough) and my girlfriend lives in Philadelphia. I've been avoiding thinking about how I won't be able to see or talk to them much and I think it's time to jsut accept it. This is such a special experience that I am truly grateful to have and will need the support of those around me.

        <p>
     <h2>What are the benefits of Version Control?</h2>
     To better understand Version Control, I like to imagine a Word document that only allows you to save documents as new documents, so you can never save over a document you already saved. Editing a paper you wrote and saved as "Paper"? Well you have to save your edit as "Paper-Edit-1".  Of course, version control does allow you to keep and update a master version, but it keeps track of all your edits in much the same way as my twisted example above.
     The benefits of this are that you (1) never lose previous work in case you royally screw up your project and (2) can work with many different people in many different places at the same time and not step on eachothers toes. Elaborating on benefit (2),this means that more than one person can be working on that paper that's due at midnight at the same time and your version control system will lump the two edits together into a beatufil master document as long as you didn't changes the same parts!
    </p>
    <p>
       <h2> How does git help you keep track of changes?</h2>
        Git keeps track of changes through the 3 levels of working, tracked, and committed.  So you work on your document locally on your own computer and save it.  According to git, you're document is now in the working stage.  All you have to do it add it to git via "git add <file>" and it is now in the tracked stage.  Review your work one more time to make sure you are satisfied with your update and type in "git commit" and there you go! Your changes are now saved as a commit.  Feel free to type in "git push" and your new update will be pushed to your remote space (such as Github).
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2> Why use Github to store your code? </h2>
        Github gives you a place to push your commits to a remote place where it is accessible by anyone (with access to your profile) on any computer (maybe you're at a different computer). It shows your master code, all the branches, and all the commits.  It also includes a social aspect that allows you to connect with friends, colleagues, and even strangers to share and write code.  It seems like a great environment for any developer.
