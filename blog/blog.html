        <h2>Version Control, Git & Github</h2>

     <h2>What are the benefits of Version Control?</h2>
     To better understand Version Control, I like to imagine a Word document that only allows you to save documents as new documents, so you can never save over a document you already saved. Editing a paper you wrote and saved as "Paper"? Well you have to save your edit as "Paper-Edit-1".  Of course, version control does allow you to keep and update a master version, but it keeps track of all your edits in much the same way as my twisted example above.
     The benefits of this are that you (1) never lose previous work in case you royally screw up your project and (2) can work with many different people in many different places at the same time and not step on eachothers toes. Elaborating on benefit (2),this means that more than one person can be working on that paper that's due at midnight at the same time and your version control system will lump the two edits together into a beatufil master document as long as you didn't changes the same parts!
    </p>

       <h2> How does git help you keep track of changes?</h2>
        Git keeps track of changes through the 3 levels of working, tracked, and committed.  So you work on your document locally on your own computer and save it.  According to git, you're document is now in the working stage.  All you have to do it add it to git via "git add <file>" and it is now in the tracked stage.  Review your work one more time to make sure you are satisfied with your update and type in "git commit" and there you go! Your changes are now saved as a commit.  Feel free to type in "git push" and your new update will be pushed to your remote space (such as Github).
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2> Why use Github to store your code? </h2>
        Github gives you a place to push your commits to a remote place where it is accessible by anyone (with access to your profile) on any computer (maybe you're at a different computer). It shows your master code, all the branches, and all the commits.  It also includes a social aspect that allows you to connect with friends, colleagues, and even strangers to share and write code.  It seems like a great environment for any developer.
