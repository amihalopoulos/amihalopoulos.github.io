    <h2>Classes & Modules</h2>
    <h4>Sunday Feb 22, 2015</h4>
  </div>
<section>

<p>
When studying modules, the first thing you hear is that they are very similar to classes. This is true in the way they are written and that they both hold methods, but that’s about the extent of their similarities.  Although they can be used to do the same things at times, they should not be used interchangeably — there is a right and wrong construct to use.  Since I covered classes in last week’s post, refer back to that if you need a refresher.
</p>
<p>
When thinking of modules, it’s safe to think of their purpose as providing a library of methods (usually across classes), while classes are used to make instances of itself (objects) with predefined methods and variables.  You cannot instantiate a module. One of the main benefits of a module is how it acts a collection of methods that can be used by many classes.If you ever have a class that you are not creating instances of, it should probably be a module.
</p>
<p>
The second advantage of modules is namesapcing.  Since modules are often loaded into programs from other files, the possibility of two methods having the identical names but different characteristics is very high. Modules takes care of this by namespacing.  Without namespacing, it would be very confusing to know which of two identically names methods will be run by the program.  To namespace, you would write the name of the module, plus two colons, followed by the method/class from the module. Like so, ModuleName::Method.  This will explicitly refer to the method from that particular module if need be.
</p>
<p>
  Here is how you would write a module and include that module in a class:
</p>
  <pre><code>
module ThisIsAModule
  def method_1
    things
  end
end

class ThisIsAClass
  include ThisIsAModule

  def method_2
  end
end

</code></pre>

        <h2>Pairing & Feedback @ DBC </h2>
        <h4>Sunday Feb 15, 2015</h4>
      </div>

      <section>
        <p>
This blog post will focus on my experience thus far with pair programming during Phase 0 of DBC.  So far in my career as a student at DBC, I've had the opportunity to pair program at least 10 times. So I've had the chance to solve problems with 10 different people of all different experiences and personalities, and get feedback from each one of them.
</p>
<p>
Solving challenges via pair programming can be a little bit tricky. I consider myself a good problem solver and I have a method of breaking problems down in order to solve them.  After doing this, I like to visualize each step I will take to solve said problem.  This process may not be the most time-effective, but it allows me to prepare myself for any unintended challenges that may arise throughout the process.  Understandably, other people have their own ways of solving problems as well.  Often, I find my pair trying to jump into the problem before I am mentally ready. This can get a little frustrating for both of us, so I like to discuss our problem-solving preferances before we get into the challenge at hand.  However, when I have clear, open, and flowing conversation with a pair, it is VERY fun to run through a problem and finish in a half hour and say "That's it?" That has only happened twice, but it's a great feeling.
</p>
<p>
After each pairing session, DBC requires us to leave feedback for the person we paired with.  Reading what people thought of working with me was a very eye-opeing experience.  It was neat because all of the reviews were pretty similar. Specifically, almost every person complimented my patience and solid communication. I'm not sure if everyone says that about everyone, but it was good to hear becuase those were two things that I was specifically working on.  For the future, I'm going to try to improve even further on these two things.  I am also going to focus on writing better feedback.  Telling it straight is actually the nicest thing you can do, because it allows people to improve on themselves.  That has been tough for me because I don't want to be rude sometimes.

       So you probably know how to declare variables and even define your own methods. Well, now it is time to start storing some of that knowledge into your very own classes! Why would you want to make your own class, you ask? Well say you want to create a legion of minions in your program.  Each one has the abilities to cook, sing, clean, make jokes, etc.  Instead of writing new methods every single time you want to create a minion, you could write a class called minion. Each instance of this class will be represent each invidivual minion. Below I create a class Minion and make three new instances.
<pre>
<code>
class Minion
  def initialize (name, eyes)
  @name = name
  @eyes = eyes
  end
end

kevin = Minion.new("Kevin", 2)
steve = Minion.new("Steve", 1)
</code>
</pre>
<p>
One the first line, I named the new class Minion. Then I defined the initialize method. This method is very useful because it automatically runs everything inside it as soon as an instance of the class is created.  The method takes two arguments, name and number of eyes. It then assigns each of those arguments to an instance varaible.  You assign instance variables with the @ sign.  These variables will be available for every subsequent method in its individual instance of the class Minion and only that instance.  For example, the variable @eyes for kevin will not affect Steve ever, in any way. The two are completely separate.  On the last two lines I made an instance of Minion named kevin and one of steve.

        <h1>Cultural Blog: Problems in the Tech Industry</h1>
        <h2>Perfomance Enhancing Drugs in Tech</h2>
        <h4>Sun Feb 8, 2015</h4>
      </div>

      <section>
        <p>
As part of my cultural blog for Dev Bootcamp, this week I explored a problem facing the tech industry: Drug Abuse.  Specifically, the use of adderall in the workplace.  This is a problem that is not prone to the tech industry exclusively.  In fact, it moslty derides from college habits where students need something stronger than caffeine to stay up late in order to finish assignments.  As Cori Johnson, author of the article "Adderall Has a Tech Industry Problem," points out, adderall is also seen as a more socially-acceptable version of cocaine to be consumed during late night parties.  However, the problem stems even further to the doctors who overprescribe the drug, the patients who oversell their symptoms to obtain the prescription, and even the general public knowledge of the disease, ADHD, itself. Its rampid use throughout the tech industry is very understandable.  From an employee's perspective this will make them exponentially more productive, more valuable as an asset, and in turn, make them more money.  Being more prodcutive will please their boss, the board of directors, the investors, and the shareholders. Being able to get important projects done in short time is what it's all about.  And hey, if everyone is doing it, what choice do you have?
</p>
<p>
The issue here is very similar to that of steroid use in baseball.  Everyone is trying to be the best programmer they can and get as much done in as little time as possible just how all baseball players want to maximize their workout results and be as fast and strong as possible.  When you see other guys getting amazing results after using these drugs and getting paid handsomely for it, it's really tempting to cheat the system and get that leg up on the competition.
</p>
<p>
In terms of resolving this issue in the tech industry, there isn't much you can do.  Since the industry isn't glorified the way baseball is, it will probably never see a crackdown on performance enhancing drugs and the label of "cheater" applied to those who use them.  I think the general public needs to be better educated on ADHD and the use of adderall.  In addition, it would help if a big company, such as Facebook, came out and acknowledged the issue and took baby steps towards reconciling it. Maybe periodic drug tests? To be honest, a company would probably forfeit pretty substantial profits in order to rid themselves of the pervasive use of adderall.

        <h1>Ruby Enumerables</h1>
        <h2>Enumerable#cycle</h2>
        <h4>Tuesday Feb 3, 2015</h4>
      </div>

      <section>
    <p>
    After doing a lot of digging through Google, I learned about the Enumerable#cycle method and it’s pretty [bleeping] cool.  To start, I’ll walk you through the basic stuff and once we get that down, I’ll show you how the fun tricks with it. <br>
    At its core, the #cycle method runs a block either n times or, if you don’t specify, forever. You set it up like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
      >> shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "grapes"]
      => ["apples", "bananas", "grapes"]
      >> shopping_list.cycle {|x| puts x}
      apples
      bananas
      grapes
      apples
      bananas
      grapes
      apples
      bananas
      grapes
      apples
      bananas
      grapes
      [... and on and on and on. This is where I hit control + c]
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
    Pretty simple.  Now lets add our number to break it after that many cycles.
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code>
   >> shopping_list. cycle(2) {|x| puts x}
  apples
  bananas
  grapes
  apples
  bananas
  grapes
  => nil
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
Now, to get a little fancier, you can write the break inside of the block:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
>> shopping_list.cycle do |x|
>> puts x
>> break if x == "grapes"
>> end
apples
bananas
grapes
=> nil
</code>
</pre>
    <p>
Not amused? Well maybe this will get ya going: If you set a variable equal to the result of running #cycle on an Enumerable, then that object can have #next called on it to return the next item in the sequence. Let me clarify with an example:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>
>> food_items = shopping_list.cycle
=> #<Enumerator: ["apples", "bananas", "grapes"]:cycle>
>> food_items.next
=> "apples"
>> food_items.next
=> "bananas"
>> food_items.next
=> "grapes"
>> food_items.next
=> "apples"
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Is that cool enough for you?! You can even call #rewind on the object and have it start again from the beginning of the cycle! Watch it in action (the following code continues from where the previous code left off) :
  </p>
  <pre>
<code>
>> food_items.next
=> "apples"
>> food_items.next
=> "bananas"
>> food_items.rewind
=> #<Enumerator: ["apples", "bananas", "grapes"]:cycle>
>> food_items.next
=> "apples"
</code>
</pre>

<p> Disclaimer: There may still be more to learn about htis method.  This is what I could find from in-depth google search that did not return too much information.  I will update with my future findings.  Until then, Happy Coding!

        <h2>My thinking style</h2>
        <h4>Wednesday Jan 28, 2015</h4>
      </div>

      <section>
        <p>
          From taking the Gregorc Thinking Style Test, I learned that I was an Abstract Random (AR) Thinker.  Well, technically I am an abstract random thinker, even though I scored a 32 in that category while I scored a 28 on every other category. So in reality, I (as well as most people, I presume)probably have more of a hybrid thinking style.  However, for the sake of this blog I'm going to assume that I am an Abstract Random thinker because the characteristics of such thinkers do in fact resonate with me.  Thelearningweb.com defines AR thinkers as people who "organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments."  In line with AR thinkers, I learned that I learn best when I am..
            <ul>
              <li>in a personalized environment</li>
              <li>given broad/generalized directions</li>
              <li>able to maintain friendly relationships</li>
              <li>able to participate in group activities</li>
            </ul>
          In addition, I learned as an AR thinker that I need
            <ul>
              <li>frequent feedback</li>
              <li>ability to use my creativity</li>
              <li>teamwork and collaboration</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is that Dev Bootcamp seems to offer the perfect environment for someone like me. The bad news is that such an environment can also be stressful for me.  From doing more research, I learned that Abstract Random thinkers are inclined to be very in tune with other peoples emotions and try to make everyone happy.  For example, if you were to ask me if I wanted chinese or italian food for dinner, though I know exactly which one I want, I would have trouble speaking up out of fear that my choice would keep you from having what you want. Yes, yes, yes, and yes.  That happens to me all the time.  In fact, this has led to my only struggle in DBC so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times, pairing has been a struggle for me so far.  There have been a couple occurences where I was very confident in what my pair and I needed to do in order to solve a problem, but did not speak up immediately because my pair was speaking aloud as he/she tried to solve the problem in a way I knew was incorrect.  I just feel bad/awkward telling them that what they are doing is wrong.  This is something I will need fix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going forward, I plan to be patient and ask questions when pairing.  There is a right way and a wrong way to go about telling someone they are wrong, and it is important to make sure to correct someone before going down a rabbit hole when pairing.  Also, I would like to challenge myself to try and learn harder programming concepts.  Reading about Fixed vs Growth mindsets taught me that its okay to fail and/or not understand something.  That's what Dev Bootcamp is all about. If I fall on my face trying to solve a problem, I have a great community and opportunity to help pick me up and set me down a path towards success.

        <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
        <h4>Wednesday Jan 28, 2015</h4>
      </div>
      <section>
        <p>Arrays</p>
        <p>Think of an array as an empty bucket.  Whenever you want it, you just pick it up and toss whatever you'd like in it. In Ruby, all you need to do is name the bucket and either leave it as empty for future use or name the bucket and say what you want to put it in it.  You can put strings, numbers, more arrays, hashes, etc. Arrays can hold pretty much anyhting. You can create an empty array one of two ways:
           <p> Method 1: <br>
            new_array = [] <br>
            Method 2: <br>
            new_array = Array.new() </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, you can add values to an array at the same time as you create it. Like so: </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                new_array = ["cat", "hat", "bat"]
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>To access an item in your array, you type the number where the item is located in the array in brackets after the array.  Remember that arrays are numbered starting from 0. So in the above example, to access "cat" you would type:<br>
            </p>
            <pre> <code>
                > new_array = ["cat","hat", "bat"]
                => ["cat", "hat", "bat"]
                > new_array[0]
                => "cat"
                > new_array[1]
                => "hat"
                > new_array[2]
                => "bat"
                > new_array[3]
                => nil
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                Arrays come with their own set of methods from the class Array.  In addition, you can add two arrays as well as subtract them.  Adding arrays will put all the values of the two arrays into one array. Subtracting one array from a second array will return all the items of the first array that were not in the second array.  Lastly, you can find all common items of two arrays by joining them with an ampersand (&) likes so: <br>
                    >[1,2,3]&[2,3,4]<br>
                    => [2,3]
            </p>
            <p>Arrays have many more methods that come with their class. Check them out.</p>
            <p>Hashes</p>
            <p>
                Hashes are very similar to arrays in that they both store data.  The main difference is that hashes store their data through the use of "keys" and "values" while arrays store their data by using indices. So all data in a hash is a value and every value has a key. Making a hash is similar to making a new array. Only difference is the use of squiggly brackets {} instead of square [] that are used for arrays: </p>
                <pre><code>
                > new_hash = Hash.new
                => {}
                > new_hash = {}
                => {}
                </code></pre>
                <p>To match a value to a key when creating a new hash, you use the hash rocket (=>) like so:
                </p>
                <pre><code>
                favorite_athletes = {"football" => "Tom Brady", "basketball" => "Michael Jordan", "baseball" => "Derek Jeter"}
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                  Hashes are good to use when you have more data or data within data that you need to store.
                </p>
            </p>

        <h2>The Big 3 Display Property Values: Block, Inline, & Inline-block</h2>
        <h4>Friday Jan 24, 2015</h4>
      </div>
      <section>
        <p>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</p>
            <p>
            In my experience in CSS thus far, I have used the "display" property very, very often. I am sur emost of you have as well.  However, despite how much I use it, I realized that I never had a clear understanding of what each of the three manin values for this property affected the layout of my web pages.  If one didn't produce the desired layout change, I would simply try one of the others.  If you are like me, hopefully this will help better your understanding so you can save time by picking the right display value the first time, every time.
            </p>
            <p>
            When it comes to block, inline, and inline-block, the main differences are in how the width and height are set, whether or not you can change the width and height, and if it can have neighbors (only one of them can't)
            We'll start with block.  you write it like so:
            </p>
                display: block; <br>
            What you need to know about blocks:<br>
                1. width is is set by its parent and its height set by its content.<br>
                2. You CAN change the widths and heights.<br>
                3. This DOES NOT ALLOW horizontal neighbors--This means if you use a block, the content inside that block will be the only content on that line.<br>
            <p>
            Next up, inline.  Written as:
            display: inline; <br>
            What you need to know about inline: <br>
                1. An element set to Inline will have its width and height determined by its content.<br>
                2. You cannot change the height and width. It will simply be the size of the content you put in.<br>
            </p>

            What you need to know about inline-block:<br>
                1. It's the same as block<br>

                2. Width is determined by its content.<br>
                3. BUT, you CAN set its width and height.<br>

        <h2>Culture at DBC: My thoughts heading into DBC</h2>

    <p>
      The DBC experience is definitely a once in a lifetime experience. It will truly be an educational rollercoaster unlike any that I have ever experienced before.  In addition to learning how to be a world-class beginner at web development, I'm expected to open myself up to the experience and really discover myself. I feel as though this bootcamp is about learning more about myself as much as it is learning how to code. It is completely different from all the formal education I have ever had and I can't wait to get to campus.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm going all in on DBC.  I've spent my savings on it, cleared my schedule (and my mind), and am ready to take this challenge full on.  If I don't make it out alive, it will truly be because I'm not capable and not because I didn't work hard enough.  The day I first walk through those doors will be with an open mind and open heart.  I am bringing my full self and just hope that its enough to survive!  Honestly, I'm the most nervous about leaving the people in my life for so long. My family is in New Jersey (and my 1 1/2 year old puppy, Barry, who I'm sure I'll talk about more than enough) and my girlfriend lives in Philadelphia. I've been avoiding thinking about how I won't be able to see or talk to them much and I think it's time to jsut accept it. This is such a special experience that I am truly grateful to have and will need the support of those around me.

        <h2>Version Control, Git & Github</h2>

     <h2>What are the benefits of Version Control?</h2>
     To better understand Version Control, I like to imagine a Word document that only allows you to save documents as new documents, so you can never save over a document you already saved. Editing a paper you wrote and saved as "Paper"? Well you have to save your edit as "Paper-Edit-1".  Of course, version control does allow you to keep and update a master version, but it keeps track of all your edits in much the same way as my twisted example above.
     The benefits of this are that you (1) never lose previous work in case you royally screw up your project and (2) can work with many different people in many different places at the same time and not step on eachothers toes. Elaborating on benefit (2),this means that more than one person can be working on that paper that's due at midnight at the same time and your version control system will lump the two edits together into a beatufil master document as long as you didn't changes the same parts!
    </p>
    <p>
       <h2> How does git help you keep track of changes?</h2>
        Git keeps track of changes through the 3 levels of working, tracked, and committed.  So you work on your document locally on your own computer and save it.  According to git, you're document is now in the working stage.  All you have to do it add it to git via "git add <file>" and it is now in the tracked stage.  Review your work one more time to make sure you are satisfied with your update and type in "git commit" and there you go! Your changes are now saved as a commit.  Feel free to type in "git push" and your new update will be pushed to your remote space (such as Github).
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2> Why use Github to store your code? </h2>
        Github gives you a place to push your commits to a remote place where it is accessible by anyone (with access to your profile) on any computer (maybe you're at a different computer). It shows your master code, all the branches, and all the commits.  It also includes a social aspect that allows you to connect with friends, colleagues, and even strangers to share and write code.  It seems like a great environment for any developer.
