            <p>
                Today, I spent some time researching Stereotype Threat for my required cultural blog at Dev Bootcamp. The research was more of a refresher from my freshman year long stint as an undergrad psych major, and surprisingly the info came back to me fairly quickly. It’s actually a pretty interesting affliction that causes members of a minority to perform worse on assessments when reminded of the stereotypes and prejudices that society has labeled on their group via a form of self-fulfilling prophecy.

            <p>
                I’m a white middle class, college graduate male. Personally, I can’t say I really know what it feels like to be a minority. I’ve never been discriminated against and I’ve never felt inferior due to my socio-economic status. I’m not going to pretend like there’s a negative stigma against me or “my people.” For all I know, there probably is but be that as it may I’ve never felt it nor would I really pay attention to it personally. The closest I can get to relating is that people have often acted surprised when they see or find out that I’m smart. I don’t have a definitive answer for why people are surprised by this, but I can say it doesn’t bother me.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I saw someone suffering from the stereotype threat, I’d probably tell them that I like being the underdog and that I think it would help serve a lot of people to embrace that mentality. The only thing stopping you from kicking ass in school or work is you. Mentality is everything and you have to know that you can do it and that you are good enough. There’s no room for excuses when you want to be successful.

                My viewpoints are very skewed, but knowing that my dad “made it” in America after coming here from Greece with no money at age 23 has made me a firm believer of the classic “hard work pays off” mantra. From that I’ve learned that there’s no substitution for hard work.
