                    <p> If you seek answers, you must ask questions. Good questions. This is an basic concept in life that many people overlook but has huge payoffs if executed correctly. It is especially important in the tech field (and if you are a DBC student) where learning and understanding is everything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Good questions are specific. They contain all necessary information and clearly define the problem you are trying to solve. Think about it. Before you ask a question, ask the question to yourself and pretend as though you have no prior knowledge of the situation. You’ll realize that it is critical to include all pertinent information in a clear, succinct, and direct way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another helpful exercise you can practice before asking questions is to formulate your question into a google search. You don’t want unnecessary words in your search query, otherwise you will get unintended answers to a different question. Of course, you can be a little more wordy and use proper english in an actual question to a human being. These tips are most helpful when formulating a title and stating your problem of the question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, you should be able to provide a solid example of where you are stuck. It’s usually better to offer some concrete code. It doesn’t matter if it works or not, as long as the person reviewing it can see where you are going wrong. Never be afraid to ask questions! Those who ask the most get the most! And once you have your question answered, teach others! Somebody will eventually have the same question as you and now you will be a resource of knowledge for them. So ask away!
