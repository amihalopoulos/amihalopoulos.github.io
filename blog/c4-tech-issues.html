                As part of my cultural blog for Dev Bootcamp, this week I explored a problem facing the tech industry: Drug Abuse. Specifically, the use of adderall in the workplace. This is a problem that is not prone to the tech industry exclusively. In fact, it moslty derides from college habits where students need something stronger than caffeine to stay up late in order to finish assignments. As Cori Johnson, author of the article "Adderall Has a Tech Industry Problem," points out, adderall is also seen as a more socially-acceptable version of cocaine to be consumed during late night parties. However, the problem stems even further to the doctors who overprescribe the drug, the patients who oversell their symptoms to obtain the prescription, and even the general public knowledge of the disease, ADHD, itself. Its rampid use throughout the tech industry is very understandable. From an employee's perspective this will make them exponentially more productive, more valuable as an asset, and in turn, make them more money. Being more prodcutive will please their boss, the board of directors, the investors, and the shareholders. Being able to get important projects done in short time is what it's all about. And hey, if everyone is doing it, what choice do you have?

                The issue here is very similar to that of steroid use in baseball. Everyone is trying to be the best programmer they can and get as much done in as little time as possible just how all baseball players want to maximize their workout results and be as fast and strong as possible. When you see other guys getting amazing results after using these drugs and getting paid handsomely for it, it's really tempting to cheat the system and get that leg up on the competition.

                In terms of resolving this issue in the tech industry, there isn't much you can do. Since the industry isn't glorified the way baseball is, it will probably never see a crackdown on performance enhancing drugs and the label of "cheater" applied to those who use them. I think the general public needs to be better educated on ADHD and the use of adderall. In addition, it would help if a big company, such as Facebook, came out and acknowledged the issue and took baby steps towards reconciling it. Maybe periodic drug tests? To be honest, a company would probably forfeit pretty substantial profits in order to rid themselves of the pervasive use of adderall.
