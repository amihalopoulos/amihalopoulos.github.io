            <p>
                As part of the cultural portion of DBC this week, I’m going to write about my values. After exploring what values make me happy, I’ve chosen to pick one and write a little about why it matters to me. The specific value I’d like to talk about is achievement. I chose this one because it is really a guiding light in my life. Since graduating college, I’ve been struck by a need for achievement. For some reason I now have a strong desire to make the absolute most of my life (that desire was clearly lacking in college). I think this was the force that guided me into programming so soon after receiving my diploma. Achieving past goals not only brought me immediate happiness, but allows me to look back and re-experience those emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of people asking me for advice, that doesn’t happen very often and I can’t even remember the last time somebody asked me for meaningful advice.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think my thirst for accomplishment can help me overcome stereotype threat if I ever experience it. That kind of ties into what I talked about last week with just focusing on what you are capable of and blocking the rest of the world out. If I want to accomplish my goals, then that’s the kind of willful determination I need. As long as I focus on what I want to accomplish day in and day out then I can put all my efforts towards that and in time I can accomplish what I want.
