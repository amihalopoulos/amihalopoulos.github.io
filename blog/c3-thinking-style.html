                From taking the Gregorc Thinking Style Test, I learned that I was an Abstract Random (AR) Thinker. Well, technically I am an abstract random thinker, even though I scored a 32 in that category while I scored a 28 on every other category. So in reality, I (as well as most people, I presume)probably have more of a hybrid thinking style. However, for the sake of this blog I'm going to assume that I am an Abstract Random thinker because the characteristics of such thinkers do in fact resonate with me. Thelearningweb.com defines AR thinkers as people who "organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments." In line with AR thinkers, I learned that I learn best when I am..
                <ul>
                    <li>in a personalized environment</li>
                    <li>given broad/generalized directions</li>
                    <li>able to maintain friendly relationships</li>
                    <li>able to participate in group activities</li>
                </ul>
                In addition, I learned as an AR thinker that I need
                <ul>
                    <li>frequent feedback</li>
                    <li>ability to use my creativity</li>
                    <li>teamwork and collaboration</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                The good news is that Dev Bootcamp seems to offer the perfect environment for someone like me. The bad news is that such an environment can also be stressful for me. From doing more research, I learned that Abstract Random thinkers are inclined to be very in tune with other peoples emotions and try to make everyone happy. For example, if you were to ask me if I wanted chinese or italian food for dinner, though I know exactly which one I want, I would have trouble speaking up out of fear that my choice would keep you from having what you want. Yes, yes, yes, and yes. That happens to me all the time. In fact, this has led to my only struggle in DBC so far.

                At times, pairing has been a struggle for me so far. There have been a couple occurences where I was very confident in what my pair and I needed to do in order to solve a problem, but did not speak up immediately because my pair was speaking aloud as he/she tried to solve the problem in a way I knew was incorrect. I just feel bad/awkward telling them that what they are doing is wrong. This is something I will need fix.
            </p>
            <p>
                Going forward, I plan to be patient and ask questions when pairing. There is a right way and a wrong way to go about telling someone they are wrong, and it is important to make sure to correct someone before going down a rabbit hole when pairing. Also, I would like to challenge myself to try and learn harder programming concepts. Reading about Fixed vs Growth mindsets taught me that its okay to fail and/or not understand something. That's what Dev Bootcamp is all about. If I fall on my face trying to solve a problem, I have a great community and opportunity to help pick me up and set me down a path towards success.
