                As a beginner to Ruby, as well as programming in general, I felt intimidated by Rails. I didn’t have the slightest inkling of how to use it or even what it was. I didn’t find many people on the web who offered a quick and simple explanation of what Rails is. And while I’m still in the early stages of beginning to fully understand Ruby on Rails, I wrote this to serve as a guide for not just newbies, but also myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best way I found to think of Rails is simply as a web starter pack.

                Imagine getting a box to make a toy model airplane. All the materials you need are in the box: the foam body and wings, the plastic pieces to connect them, the fake propellers, and whatever else may come with a model airplane. You get to decorate the airplane any way you want and you can then do whatever you want with the airplane. You can leave it blank and while it will fly, it won’t really do much. Or you can deck it out with flames and a face on the front and use a slingshot to make it glide through the air. So in this weird example, the box with all the materials is Ruby on Rails and the extra colors, designs, and capabilities you add to the plane are the Ruby code and HTML/CSS elements.

                In more technical terms, Rails is a collection of code files that were written to save programmers time by standardizing the web application requirements/basics. All the developer needs to do is plug his/her bits of code into the rails framework to have a site up and running in no time. It is pretty much a software/package library.

                My next blog will be about an important aspect of rails, the Model View Controller. Stay tuned!
