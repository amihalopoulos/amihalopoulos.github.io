        Pair programming is a strategy for developers to approach a hands-on subject on one computer.
        Usually, one person drives while the other navigates and the pair shares and discuss ideas as they
        work together. Pair programming can be done either in person or online.  A key benefit is the ability
        to work out problems with another person and have another set of eyes to check your work.

      <h2>Why is PP important to DBC</h2>
      <p>
        Pair programming is important to learning, People with different learning style are working together. Most
        of us are beginners. You can learn a lot by pairing with someone who is better than you. If you know
        thing that you can teach your pair, it can solidfy that topic by explaining or teaching that concept to
        your peer. Everyone is supporting eachother and everyone is working problems out together.

      <h2>Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
      <p>
        Both throw out ideas and help eachother. The driver will be the one pair of hands on a computer at a time, so that
        person will get hands on experience.  The other with get experience getting eyes on the project and will be
        able to look up references and jot down notes while the driver codes.

  <!-- Add your reflection here.
  Reflection: This was gerat practice.  It was great html practice and it was also great pairing practice.  I have been having a tough time with pairing, but George was great and I was able to incorporate some feedback from previous pairing experiences to make this one run smoother.  The hour ran up kind of quickly, so we didn't get as far as we would have liked. We both have other work to get done though so we could not continue.  I think we nailed the learning competencies for this exercise though. I'm very pumped.
